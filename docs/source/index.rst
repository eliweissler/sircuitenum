Welcome to sircuitenum's documentation!
=======================================

On this page you can find documentation of the superconducting circuit enumeration package, as well as all unique qubits containing three nodes or fewer. Additionally displayed are :doc:`Basegraph_Summary` up to five nodes in size, which are used do describe the unique circuit topoligies used in the enumeration procedure.

Basegraphs are the set of `non-isomorphic, connected simple graphs <https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/graphs.html>`_ generated by `Brendan McKay <https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/>`_ from Australian National University.
